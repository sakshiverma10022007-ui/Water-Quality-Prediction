# 💧 Water Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📘 Project Overview
This project aims to predict **water quality** using various chemical and physical parameters.  
By analyzing the dataset, a machine learning model is trained to determine if the water is safe or contaminated based on measurable attributes.

## 🧾 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is **"Drinking Water Quality Distribution Monitoring Data"**.  
It contains information such as:
- Turbidity (NTU)
- Fluoride (mg/L)
- Residual Free Chlorine (mg/L)
- E.coli (Quanti-Tray) (MPN/100mL)
- Other chemical and physical indicators

The data was cleaned, processed, and used for model training and evaluation.
